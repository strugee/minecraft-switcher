# minecraft-switcher changelog

minecraft-switcher follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver]. Specifically, the following things are considered to be semver-major if changed in a backwards-incompatible way:

* Configuration value names, semantics, requirements and format
* Supported Node.js versions
* This list of items

Changes to everything else are not considered breaking. Notably, these are _not_ considered breaking:

* The web UI's private HTTP API
* Log messages

If you think something that isn't in the first list should be covered, or aren't sure about something, please feel free to file an issue and I'll clarify the policy - this list could surely be more precise.

## 1.0.0 - future

* Initial release

 [semver]: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html
